title: Hello World

Astronomy compels the soul to look upward, and leads us from this world to another.

Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next 10.

We want to explore. We’re curious people. Look back over history, people have put their lives at stake to go out and explore … We believe in what we’re doing. Now it’s time to go.

When I orbited the Earth in a spaceship, I saw for the first time how beautiful our planet is. Mankind, let us preserve and increase this beauty, and not destroy it!

Many say exploration is part of our destiny, but it’s actually our duty to future generations and their quest to ensure the survival of the human species.
